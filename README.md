# Kmer counting using parallel computation.

Hi there! With this badass code you can utilize all the cores on your system to count the occourance of kmers in a fasta file.

#HOW TO USE
1) Download repository (including test file humantest.fsa)
2) Run the run_parallel.py
3) Alternativly provide your own fasta file and simple change the filename in line 116 of run_parallel.py
4) Then save and run again :-)!

Credits to Peter Wad @ DTU denmark for providing the majority of this code.
